        <h2>Description</h2>
        <p>Choux pastry is an easy, low cost way of making a very versatile base for many recipes, both salty and sweet.</p>
        <h3>Ingredients</h3>
        <ul>
            <li>Water - 30g</li>
            <li>Butter - 60g</li>
            <li>Salt - tbsp</li>
            <li>Flour - 30g</li>
            <li>Eggs - 1</li>
        </ul>
        <h3>Steps</h3>
        <ol>
            <li>Melt the butter with the water and salt in a pot. Bring to boil.</li>
            <li>Remove from the stove and add the sifted flour all at once. Stir with a wooden spoon.</li>
            <li>Put back on the stove to dry out the water. It should be ready when a white layer forms on the walls of the pot and the dough detaches easily from them.</li>
            <li>Remove from the stove, let it cool down and add the egg. If you're using more ingredients than this recipe suggest, remember to add one egg at a time.</li>
            <li>Stir until the dough is smooth and homogeneous.</li>
            <li>Put on a baking sheet in the desired form (beignet, vol-au-vent, etc.) and put in the pre-heated oven at 180Â°C for about 25 minutes, until it starts browning.</li>
            <li>Turn off the oven, slightly open the door and let the choux inside for about 10 minutes to dry.</li>
        </ol>
